- `src/features/`: Core business logic (voices, text-to-speech, billing).
- `src/app/`: Next.js App Router and API routes.
- `src/trpc/`: Typesafe API definitions and routers.
- `src/lib/`: Shared client/server utilities (DB, R2, Polar).
- `src/components/ui/`: Low-level shadcn/ui components.
- `chatterbox_tts.py`: The Modal-deployed Python TTS engine.
